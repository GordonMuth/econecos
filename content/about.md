## The Economic Ecosystem

> An economic ecosystem is a community of people in conjunction with the components and institutions that interact within a financial system. These living and non-living components are linked together through things like employment contracts, financial instruments, government policies and trade agreements.

Most of us have been taught that we live within an interconnected ecological system. Some of us might even understand the complex relationships that promote healthy biological organisms within an ecosystem. However, few of us seem to understand the financial elements that impact the health of our economic ecosystem.

On this site we will explore our relationships with the components and institutions inside our economic ecosystem, consider the impact that "popular" proposals would have on our financial system and attempt to identify equitable alternatives that would promote financial health.
